# Sample Application

This application is created just to showcase how to embed an existing angular application inside a spring boot thymeleaf web application.

the build artifacts from the angular project , i.e from its dist folder are being copied to the src/main/resources/templates folder of the java application.

two different routes can be configured by controllers to render two completely different web pages.
